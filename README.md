# Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration [x]
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) [ ]
* SQL Injection (SQLi) [ ]
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [ ]
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [ ]
* Session Hijacking/Fixation [ ]

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration - The website that gave away the enumeration was the one that would use the word "failed" opposed to "failure" in their script.
